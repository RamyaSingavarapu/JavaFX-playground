# JavaFX-playground

A personal collection of small JavaFX projects and experiments.  
This repository helps me learn how to build modern desktop applications using **JavaFX**.

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand the core structure of a JavaFX application
- Practice using FXML, Scene Builder, and controllers
- Explore stages, scenes, layouts, and event handling
- Learn to style UIs with CSS
- Build small feature demos (buttons, menus, animations, etc.)
